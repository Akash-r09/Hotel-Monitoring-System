  <h1>Hotel Management System</h1>

  <p>
    The Hotel Management System is a software application that computerizes the management of an entire hotel.
    It is developed using <strong>Python</strong> as the frontend and <strong>MySQL</strong> as the secured backend database.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this project, data such as <em>customer details, reservation details, booking details, billing details</em>, etc.,
    are maintained in a computerized form. Managing this data becomes efficient and convenient for the staff.
    Reports can be generated and reviewed on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, making it useful for company audits.
    The proposed system is interactive, fast, and user-friendly for the end user.
